# Impact of Environmental Conditions on Marathon Runners’ Performance Based on Gender and Age

In recent years, marathon participation and performance have seen a marked increase, prompting a deeper exploration into the factors influencing outcomes in these endurance events. In collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, this study aims to assess the impact of environmental condition like temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed on marathon performance in both male and female marathon runners. This project focused on three aims: examining the effects of increasing age on marathon performance in men and women,exploring the impacts of environmental conditions on marathon performance, and whether the impact differs across age and gender, and finally identifying (WBGT, Flag conditions, temperature, etc) that have the largest impact on marathon performance. I hypothesize that increasing environmental temperatures and unfavorable weather conditions will have a negative impact on marathon performance.

In this exploratory data analysis, I conducted a detailed analysis that included line plots to examine trends in runtimes (performance) across various ages, highlighting the relationship between male and female marathon performances.Along with assessing these trends, I employed spline regression to investigate the relationship between runtimes and other key variables, providing insights into potential predictors of performance. Furthermore, correlation plots will be used to assess the strength and direction of relationships among variables, offering a comprehensive understanding of their interdependencies.

In conclusion I discovered that Boston Marathon runners exhibited the strongest overall performance. The most optimal race times were achieved by participants aged 26–35. Additionally, the analysis revealed that flag conditions, specifically Red and Yellow, had the most significant impact on marathon runners' performance.
