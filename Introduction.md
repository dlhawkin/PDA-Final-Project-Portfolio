I am Diahmin Hawkins, a passionate and detail-oriented scholar with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and biostatistics. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Tennessee State University, graduating Magna Cum Laude as a Department of Homeland Security Scholar. Following this, I pursued a Post-Baccalaureate program in Statistics at Columbia University, where I was honored as a Bridge to Ph.D. Scholar. Currently, I am advancing my expertise as a Master’s student in Biostatistics at Brown University, supported by the prestigious NextGen Scholarship and NSF Fellowship.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been deeply committed to leveraging statistical methodologies to address pressing public health issues. My experiences range from studying opioid use disparities among minority populations to analyzing global health phenomena at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. My work is driven by a commitment to uncover meaningful insights that influence equitable health interventions.

I am currently enrolled in PHP 2550: Practical Data Analysis, a course that is equipping me with the skills necessary to become a well-rounded biostatistician. This course is designed to provide hands-on experience in analyzing data with scientific colleagues, focusing on the practical application of statistical methods to address real-world scientific questions. Through this course, I am learning how to effectively translate complex hypotheses into testable forms, guide data collection processes, and manipulate data into computable formats for appropriate analysis.

Key topics such as exploratory data analysis, handling missing data, fitting and checking models, simulation, predictive modeling, and presenting reproducible results are giving me a comprehensive toolkit to tackle diverse datasets. The course emphasizes not only technical skills but also the critical ability to distill complex statistical information into formats that are easily understood by scientific colleagues, a skill I see as essential for effective collaboration and impact.

The use of the R programming environment is enhancing my computational expertise, enabling me to work efficiently with data and create meaningful visualizations. By engaging with case studies across various domains, I am gaining valuable experience in applying statistical methods to real-world problems, which aligns perfectly with my goal of advancing public health through biostatistical research. This course is an integral step in my journey toward becoming a versatile and impactful biostatistician.


As part of PHP 2550: Practical Data Analysis, I have engaged in three comprehensive class projects that have provided me with practical experience in applying statistical methods to real-world problems. Each project has allowed me to tackle unique challenges, enhance my data analysis skills, and further develop my ability to communicate complex results effectively.

1. **Marathon Project**:  
   This project focused on analyzing marathon data to identify predictors of performance, such as age, gender, training hours, and environmental factors. Using R, I employed techniques like exploratory data analysis, model fitting, and predictive modeling to uncover meaningful insights. The project emphasized checking model assumptions and interpreting results in the context of performance optimization, honing my ability to translate raw data into actionable conclusions.

2. **Smoking Cessation Study**:  
   In this project, I analyzed data from a smoking cessation study, exploring predictors of abstinence and identifying potential moderators such as nicotine metabolism ratio (NMR), readiness to quit, and demographic factors. Advanced statistical methods, including handling missing data and logistic regression, were integral to the analysis. This project was particularly meaningful as it connected with my broader research interests in public health and addressing health disparities.

3. **Constrained Budget Optimization**:  
   The constrained budget project challenged me to allocate limited resources across competing priorities. Through this exercise, I learned to build simulation models and implement optimization strategies to achieve the best outcomes under financial constraints. This project deepened my understanding of decision-making under uncertainty, a skill critical for real-world applications in healthcare and policy-making.

Each of these projects has strengthened my ability to work with diverse datasets, use advanced statistical methods, and communicate findings effectively. Collectively, they represent key milestones in my development as a biostatistician capable of addressing complex problems in public health and beyond.
